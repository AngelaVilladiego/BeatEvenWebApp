__Final project for C#__

BeatEven is a site that helps you workout! You can select up to 3 different types of workouts, and we will tell you how hard to work - with a Rate of Percieved Exertion (RPE) level - and for how long. 

__What is RPE?__

RPE is a scale that defines how much physical effort a person is exerting. The scale goes from 1-10, 10 being the person's maximum effort. While BeatEven does give a rough estimation of what the user should be doing during an interval (like "Walk Slowly" or "Sprint as hard as you can"), each person's level of fitness differs. RPE is a better way to measure how hard somebody is working. 

Here are the definitions for each level on the scale:

1   - Lightest-level of activity, such as sitting on the couch or sleeping.    
2-3 - Light activity. You can carry a complete conversation and maintain this level for hours    
4-6 - Moderate Activity. You can hold a short conversation, but you're breathing heavily.    
7-8 - Vigorous Activity. You're short of breath and can only speak a sentence at a time. You're starting 
        to get uncomfortable.    
9   - Very Hard Activity. You can barely breathe and can only speak a few words at a time. It's really 
        hard to keep this up.    
10  - Max Effort Activity. You're completely out of breath and unable to talk. It feels almost 
        impossible to keep going and this can't be maintained for more than a very short period of time.
